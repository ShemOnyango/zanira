# Shop Owner Authentication Integration - Complete ✅

## Summary
Successfully integrated shop owner authentication into the registration and login flow. Shop owners can now register, login, and access their shop management dashboard seamlessly.

## 🎯 What Was Changed

### 1. Register.jsx (`frontend/src/pages/auth/Register.jsx`)

**Added Third Role Button**:
- Added "I sell Materials" button alongside "I need a Fundi" and "I am a Fundi"
- Button sets `role: 'shop_owner'` in form data
- Updated dynamic header text to show "Shop Owner" when selected

```jsx
// Three role buttons instead of two
<button onClick={() => setFormData({ ...formData, role: 'shop_owner' })}>
  I sell Materials
</button>
```

**Visual Changes**:
- Three equal-width buttons in a row
- Responsive layout (stacks on mobile)
- Selected button highlighted with gradient
- Clear, concise labels

### 2. Login.jsx (`frontend/src/pages/auth/Login.jsx`)

**Added Quick Registration Links**:
- New section below "Sign up" link
- Three quick links: Client, Fundi, Shop Owner
- Each link goes to register page with role pre-selected
- Separated by border for visual hierarchy

```jsx
// Quick role-specific registration
<Link to="/register?role=shop_owner">Shop Owner</Link>
```

**Visual Changes**:
- Small, unobtrusive quick links
- Gray background for subtle appearance
- Hover effects for better UX

### 3. App.jsx (`frontend/src/App.jsx`)

**Updated DashboardRouter**:
- Added case for `shop_owner` role
- Redirects to `/shop-dashboard` instead of generic dashboard
- Maintains existing routing for other roles

```jsx
case 'shop_owner':
  return <Navigate to="/shop-dashboard" replace />
```

**Flow**:
```
Login → Check Role → If shop_owner → /shop-dashboard
```
